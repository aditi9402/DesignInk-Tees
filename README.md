# DesignInk Tees
ThreeJS 3D product website infused with the power of artificial intelligence!

I have used:
* ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
* React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
* TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
* Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations

Features:
* Stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights.
* Made the code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices
* Added custom color and file support.
* Images can be generated and used through DALLE AI.
* The resulting t-shirt model image can be downloaded.
* Ensures responsiveness across all devices. 
* Improved site's performance.
